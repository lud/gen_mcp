# Getting Started

## Installation

Add the library to your dependencies and you will be good to go.

<!-- rdmx :app_dep vsn:$app_vsn -->
```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:gen_mcp, "~> 0.4"},
  ]
end
```
<!-- rdmx /:app_dep -->

For advanced setups, the [System Configuration guide](guides/009.system-configuration.md) contains more information to integrate the library in your system.

## Quick Start

This guide covers high level usage of the library with the default MCP server
implementation: `GenMCP.Suite` with the Streamable HTTP transport implemented by
the `GenMCP.Transport.StreamableHTTP` plug.

### Define a Test Tool

To validate your installation, you will need a valid tool, otherwise there will
be nothing much to test.

You can copy the following tool as an example:

<!-- rdmx :section name:tool_sample format:true -->
```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Tools.Addition do
  use GenMCP.Suite.Tool,
    name: "Addition",
    description: "Adds two numbers",
    input_schema: %{
      type: "object",
      properties: %{
        a: %{type: "number"},
        b: %{type: "number"}
      },
      required: ["a", "b"]
    }

  @impl true
  def call(req, channel, _arg) do
    %{"a" => a, "b" => b} = req.params.arguments
    result = GenMCP.MCP.call_tool_result(text: "#{a + b}")
    {:result, result, channel}
  end
end
```
<!-- rdmx /:section -->

### Mount the Server in your Router

Add the `GenMCP.Transport.StreamableHTTP` plug to your Phoenix or Plug router.
You configure the server details and register your tools here.

<!-- rdmx :section name:router_sample format:true -->
```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.Router do
  use MyAppWeb, :router

  pipeline :mcp do
    plug :accepts, ["json"]
  end

  scope "/mcp" do
    pipe_through :mcp

    forward "/", GenMCP.Transport.StreamableHTTP,
      server_name: "My Addition Server",
      server_version: "1.0.0",
      tools: [MyApp.Tools.Addition]
  end
end
```
<!-- rdmx /:section -->

Your MCP server is now available at `/mcp`!

## Next Steps

- Explore `GenMCP.Suite` to get a better understanding of its capabilities.
- Explore `GenMCP.Suite.Tool` to learn more about building tools, including
  asynchronous ones.
- Check out `GenMCP.Suite.ResourceRepo` to expose data as resources.
- Use `GenMCP.Suite.PromptRepo` to provide reusable prompts.
- Learn about `GenMCP.Suite.Extension` to compose functionality from multiple
  modules.
